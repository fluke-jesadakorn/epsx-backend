# Dependency Fixes Log

## 2024-02-19: Added MongoDB Health Check Dependencies

- Added `@nestjs/mongoose` and `mongoose` packages to the gateway service
- These packages were required for the MongooseHealthIndicator in health checks
- Installed using `bun add` instead of `npm install` to maintain consistency with the project's package manager

### Related Changes
- Fixed error in health controller related to missing MongoDB dependencies
- Improved service health monitoring capabilities

### Future Considerations
- Consider adding these dependencies to the project's base dependencies if MongoDB health checks will be used across multiple services
- Document MongoDB health check configuration requirements in the project setup guide
