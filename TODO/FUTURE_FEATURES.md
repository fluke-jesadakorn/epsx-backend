# Future Features and Architectural Changes

## Financial Data Processing Migration

### Context
The financial data scraping and processing logic has been moved from the Financial Service to the Scheduler Service. This change supports better separation of concerns and enables scheduled data processing.

### Current Implementation
- **Scheduler Service**: Now handles periodic data collection and processing
  - Uses cron jobs to schedule financial data scraping
  - Implements retry mechanisms and batch processing
  - Manages database operations for financial data
  - Configurable through environment variables

### Future Improvements

#### Data Processing
- [ ] Implement incremental updates to minimize database operations
- [ ] Add support for different data sources and formats
- [ ] Implement data validation and cleaning pipelines
- [ ] Add support for historical data backfilling
- [ ] Implement real-time data processing for specific metrics

#### Performance
- [ ] Optimize batch processing with adaptive concurrency
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add support for distributed processing
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing

#### Monitoring and Reliability
- [ ] Add comprehensive error tracking and reporting
- [ ] Implement health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Add automatic failover and recovery
- [ ] Implement data consistency checks
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection

#### Configuration
- [ ] Add support for dynamic scheduling
- [ ] Implement configurable processing rules
- [ ] Add support for different environments
- [ ] Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

### Technical Debt
- The current implementation uses basic error handling and retry logic
- Some type definitions could be more specific
- Need to add comprehensive testing
- Documentation could be improved

### Next Steps
1. Implement monitoring and alerting
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Optimize database operations
4. Improve error handling and recovery
5. Add support for different data sources
