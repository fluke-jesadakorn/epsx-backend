# Scheduler Gateway Connection

## Changes Made
1. Added SCHEDULER_SERVICE to Gateway's ClientsModule configuration in `apps/gateway/src/app.module.ts`
2. Added scheduler service environment variables to `apps/gateway/.env.example`:
   - SCHEDULER_SERVICE_HOST
   - SCHEDULER_SERVICE_PORT

## Future Improvements
1. Consider implementing retry strategies and circuit breakers for scheduler service communication
2. Add health checks for scheduler service in gateway's health controller
3. Consider implementing caching for scheduler responses if needed
4. Add request/response logging for scheduler service communication
